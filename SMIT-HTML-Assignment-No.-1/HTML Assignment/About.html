    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p> OBR entered Pakistan in 1997 and since then, it’s been a journey full of excitement <br/>
        and Finger Lickin’ goodness! The first OBR restaurant opened in Pakistan opened in <br/>
        Gulshan Iqbal, Karachi and now our Finger Lickin’ Chicken is available in 33 cities<br/>
        with over 117 restaurants! Being the most loved fast food chain in Pakistan,OBR le-<br/>
        aves no stone unturned to provide its customers the most delicious chicken and an <br/>
        excellent dining experience.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p> It all started with Colonel Harland Sanders, the man who convinced the world by say-<br/>
        ing “We do chicken right!” Sanders took a great deal of time perfecting his iconic <br/>
        secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices,a legacy he’s brought to the world through OBR’s<br/> 
        10,000 restaurants. Starting from outside of his gas station in Korbin, Kentucky to <br/>
        being a globally recognized face, we owe our success to the Colonel’s hard work and <br/>
        passion for sharing his love for chicken with the world!</p>
